Given a text file, we find list of propositions and a conclusion.

From those props, we build a mapping of relations.

We walk that dictionary of relations to build a dictionary of opposites, which are derived via a hardcoded list of prefixes.

We then apply that dictionary of things to the conclusion to come up with our evaluation, which returns "Confirmed", "Plausible", or "Busted", à la Mythbusters.
